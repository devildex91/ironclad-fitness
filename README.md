#### Primary Goals 
---

The primary goal of Ironclad Fitness is to provide a eye catching, informative, and easy to navigate website that will showcase all the great things about Ironclad Fitness. The main target audience for this website will be current members who want to see what else is avaliable to them at Ironclad Fitness and potential new members looking for somewhere new to train or somewhere to train for the first time.

#### Business Goals
---

The main business goal is to bring in new clients by increasing membership intake while decreasing membership fall off after a new year spike. They aim to showcase all of the great benefits of their gym that far outweigh just the equipment on the floor by showcasing what a great community spirit can be gained as well as showcasing that its not just for bodybuilders but a place for every person at every level of fitness.

#### User Goals
---

+ The user goals for new users are to find somewhere they feel comfortable to either start training for the first time or just somewhere they feel better suited to training. 
+ Current members user goals are to check what is going on at the gym such as classes they could book in for, or opening hours during holidays, as well as any special offers they may be able to take advantage of.

#### Design Choices
---
+ I have chosen to use bootstrap grid for my responsive design and where possible use bootstrap components for the bare bones.
+ Within my responsive layout I intend to keep everything centred as well as possible so it all follows the same flow.
+ My reasoning for centring most components is to keep things simple for the user, so they know where everything is going to be and like a workout you dont need to do anything flashy, just keep it simple yet effective and you will see the results you want. 
+ A responsive navbar that uses the avaliable space whilst keeping things minimalist for the best user experience.
+ Footers will be kept consistent throughout so that it is intuitive for the user and key information is allways in the same place regardless of what device is used.
+ I will put all Membership options as cards rather than a table to make them stand out and make them clear and consise to the user what the differences are. Because if I include too much information it will distract and overload the user into looking elsewhere, having the opposite effect of what we are aiming for. 
+ All sections where applicable will have a clear title to show the user what that section is about so it is easy for the user to navigate their way around the site.
+ Headers and footers will follow the same colour format and layouts no matter the page you are on so that the key information needed is allways accesible and exactly where the user expects it to be.

##### Fonts
---
+ Archivo black-Titles
+ Kite One- paragraphs  
<details>
<summary>Fonts</summary>

![font-choices](./assets/images/readme-images/font-choice.png)
</details>

+ I have chosen Archivo one because it is bold and strong and subconsciously represents the weight lifting. 
+ Kite one has been chosen for main content as it is easily readable, contrasts well to Archivo and is more of an active looking font to reference the cardio aspects of gym life.

##### Colours
---
 + #000000 black
 + #CFFFE2 Mint
 + #A2D5C6 light-cyan
+ #F6F6F6 grey

<details>

<summary>palete of colour choices</summary>

 ![palete of colors fron top to bottom black,Mint,light-cyan and grey](./assets/images/readme-images/color-choices.webp)
</details>

+ I have chosen these colors because black gives it a minimalist feel and has been shwon to add a sense of power as well as the light grey to contrast well with the black and to offer a sense of simplicity and to make it feel larger. The mint and light cyan colours have been added as they have been shown  to offer a sense of tranquility and feeling refreshed. All of these i beleive are key takeaways from what multiple people hope to feel after a gym session.

##### Styling
---
+ Fonts for styling have been imported from [google fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/selection/embed)
+ The overall colour scheme for the styling has been chosen from [color palete.](https://colorhunt.co/palette/000000cfffe2a2d5c6f6f6f6)  
+ Any favicons added will be taken from google Gemini like the pictures so they are in keeping with the same style and color scheme as the rest of the page
+ The website has been styled so that it is for the most part all centred where possible or evenly spread out to give a regimented feel like most workouts to show that its not about fancy equipment but consistency to get to your goals which means the layout matches with the views of the gym.
+ The only exception to this is the motivational quotes on the take the tour page which are designed to be off center so they stand out like intended.

[back to top](#ironclad-fitness)

##### Background
--- 
+ The navbar and footer will be styled with a black background and the light grey from the chosen colours will be used for the font in these for contrast and readability. These colours will also act as a frame drawing you into the main content sections.
+ The header section will be mint and the main content will be light cyan. This is because these colours sit nicely together without drawing too much attention away from the content of the different sections. They also clearly define the different parts of the page.
+ I debated using a background image to improve it visually but decided against as felt it would distract from the simplistic design of the page showcasing that training isnt all about using the latest fancy gimics but simple and consistent which reflects in the choices of background.

##### images
---

All images have been sourced from google Gemini to give the act like a folder of company photos. This then acts as my inspiration for the theme of the website and reflect the palete of colours chosen.
The favicons in the navbar and footer are also from google Gemini.

 <summary>4. Testing</summary>
 
 ---
+  Manual testing was carried out once uploaded checked all images loaded properly and all links worked correctly and everything behaved as it should.
+ Following manual testing I noticed the following:
+ First batch of photo werent inkeeping with the layout and theme of the page.They were  also not reacting properly as heights were coming up short so took the desicion to delete all pictures and use AI generated pictures. This helped load times and were still good quality images but with a file size about 90% smaller sacrificing a tiny bit of image quality for better visuals and a better overall build.
+ Photos were not being as reactive and sizing was still not acting as intended so an extra css class .ttt-pics has been added in to provide a min-height for alignment purposes as screen gets larger to keep it responsive and looking as it should.
+ This was done with media querys at 768px, 1200px, and 1400px wide to make sure it couldnt change from intended layout.
+ Once deployed first round of lighthouse testing was not up to scratch as the photos too large and taking too long to load.
+ Tried converting to webp file types and compressing them which improved the load time considerably but was still taking considerably longer than needed.
+ Fixed this by compressing and reducing image size as well as converting to avif files and load times improved comsiderably.
+ main section of confirmation rising on further inspection so background colour changed for confirmation page to allow the main section to move without effecting the visuals of the page.

<summary>Lighthouse tests screenshots</summary>

+ ![lighthouse test for index.html](/assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-test-index.png) 
+ ![lighthouse test for take the tour](/assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-test-ttt.png)
+ ![lighthouse test for whats on](/assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-test-whats-on.png)
+ ![lighthouse test for confirmation](/assets/images/readme-images/lighthouse-test-confirmation.png)
</details>

+ All lighthouse testing in 90s apart from whats-on page as this page displays more content in the form of google fonts slowing down loading times.
+  ALl the AI generated pictures once converted to avif files and compressed lowered the best practices score by a couple of percent but improve load times by almost 20% which i believe is a good compromise as the quality difference is unrecongnisable to the user and is only the computer picking up on the diference in quality.
